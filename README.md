#### Main Features:

- Background image that changes when user is viewing on a mobile device
- Bootstrap used for consistent and responsive design
- Form validation on input field to ensure it is not left blank and also to ensure it is an email format
- Privacy Policy linked to another page (for a live site this would need to be double checked) with link back to index.html
- Favicon uploaded to site
- Images on site compressed for fast loading


#### Questions/Notes for Designer:
- There is different text on the desktop design to the mobile and tablet designs. It has been built to match exactly the designs but can easily be changed to one or the other
- The font on the desktop design states it is 'Space Grotesk', but visually it is not, Space Grotesk has been used for consistency
- Requires the form action to be completed to register users' email address
